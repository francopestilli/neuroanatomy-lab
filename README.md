This virtual lab in neuroanatomy is subdivided into different sections. The early sections focus on anatomical strcutre, terms and organization. Later strcutres focus on the role that some of the structures play in human cognition, perception and disease.

### Each week we will have a lecture covering parts of the brain strctures

Below the links to each lecture with topics and structures.
